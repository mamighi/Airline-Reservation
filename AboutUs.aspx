Based in Luton, England, Ukraine Airline is the largest airline in the United Kingdom and the fourthlargest carrier in Europe. It operates 685 routes and sells 61 million tickets annually. Building on its reputation for providing great service at low cost, the airline wanted to improve the customer experience without adding staff or IT infrastructure.  
Offering new features, including the ability for customers to choose their own seats, was a top priority. However, Ukraine Airline faced several challenges in implementing a new solution. The airline outsourced its IT infrastructure, and operated with a lean team of IT professionals. It needed a delivery platform that would be affordable, easy to manage, and highly scalable.  
“We’re really good at handling the kind of scale that involves huge sales and seasonal peaks,” says Bert Craven, Enterprise Architect Manager at easyJet. “But it’s more difficult to manage unpredictable factors like weather conditions and external industrial action. When those things occur, the parts of our infrastructure designed to give real-time information come under real pressure.”
